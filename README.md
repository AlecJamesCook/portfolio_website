This is a flask build of a website to serve as my personal portfolio/online CV

### Advanced Functions:

**I.** User account system (Users must register or login to leave comments)

**II.** Strong password security (User passwords must contain a mixture of different characters. 
Password are stored as hash sequences in the database) 

**III.** Password reset (Users can change their password if they have forgotten it or update it if they 
please. An email is sent to their address with a time-sensitive secure token as a URL. The user must 
follow the URL to reset their password) 

**IV.** Alert system (User is alerted whenever they have interacted with the website. The website will 
display success or failure messages)

**V.** Custom error pages (Dedicated HTML templates for 500 and 404 type errors) 

**VI.** Admin panel (The website creator has the ability to view an admin panel which contains all of the 
database tables and rows. Data can be entered, edited, or deleted from this panel. Access to the 
admin panel is through a link in the navigation bar that only appears to the administrator) 

**VII.** Automatically generated webpages (The vast majority of the webpages are populated with data 
pulled from an external database) 

**VIII.** Automatically generated user profile pictures (Users are given a unique profile picture when they 
sign up through the use of Gravatar’s free service) 

**IX.** User profile page (Users have access to a profile page that shows their username, their profile 
picture, an about me section, when they last logged in, and their comment history. Users can also 
view other user’s profile pages) 

**X.** Edit profile page (Users are able to change their username after registration and their ‘about me’ 
section on their profile page) 

**XI.** Working web applications (Users are able to test out the code that I wrote for a series of programming challenges. They input the values for the functions and the website 
gives them the results) 

     **a.** Change please! – A web application that tells you if it is possible to reach a specified amount 
     using a specified number of British coins. Returns a Boolean value. 

     **b.** Five-letter unscramble – A web application that returns a list of 5 letter words from a set of 
     wordle words. Users are asked to input a minimum of five letters and the application 
     returns a list of all the wordle words that can be made from those five letters. 

     **c.** Document statistics – A web application that returns a list of different statistics about a text 
     file (The number of letters, the number of numbers, the number of symbols, the number of 
     words, the number of sentences, and the number of paragraphs). 

**XII.** Upload file function (To be used in conjunction with one of the aforementioned web applications 
(VIII: c ‘document statistics’). The user can upload a text file of their choice and the website will 
return to them the previously described statistics. File type and file size is restricted) 

**XIII.** Comment sections (There is a separate comment section for each of the web applications on the 
website. Users can post comments and interact with each other. The comment section displays the 
user’s username, profile picture, and the date and time when the comment was made after a user 
posts a comment)

### Notes
 You might be wondering why there is a "wordle.txt" in my base directory. This is because I wanted to show off my solution to the one of the wordle challenges from the previous CMT 120 homework. I couldn't get the application to find the right path for the wordle.txt file if I included it anywhere else, so I just left it in the base directory. Hope you don't mind!

 The video of my website included company and school logos on the webpages for my work experience and education pages. After looking around online I was concerned that I may be infringing copyright law by including them on my website, so I removed them from the final build. The logos have been replaced with images taken either by or for me, or of images with creative commons licenses). Apologies for the slight discrepancy between the demo video and the final website build
